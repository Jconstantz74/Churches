      <h1>Bushwick churches search for means to connect during pandemic</h1>
      <h4>By Jo Constantz | Oct. 23, 2020</h4>

      <p>On Wednesday evenings, the nave of Iglesia de la Santa Cruz and Bushwick Abbey, sister Episcopal congregations in Bushwick, Brooklyn, is open for quiet meditation and prayer. Inside, the altar of their shared space holds slips of paper with
        the names of people and things that have been lost: a loved one, a job, or a cherished activity. Visitors are invited to add something of their own. Anyone from the community is welcome, including frontline health care workers from the nearby
        hospital, Wyckoff Heights Medical Center.</p>
      <p>It has been a unique adaptation to unusual circumstances. “One of the things that's really difficult about this time is that not only have we all lost a lot of things, but we are not able to come together in a public way to acknowledge that
        loss,” said Rev. Nell Archer, the vicar at Bushwick Abbey, an episcopal church.</p>
      <p>New Yorkers are no strangers to times of crisis, and churches serve as places of spiritual and emotional support during such times. After the 9/11 attacks, thousands gathered at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Midtown Manhattan to mourn those who
        had died and hold out hope for survivors, according to a Morning Edition report by NPR’s Andy Bowers. “Only about 4,000 people could be squeezed into St. Patrick’s. Thousands more listened to loudspeakers out on Fifth Avenue.” </p>

      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic makes it difficult for churches to fulfill that vital function, preventing gatherings that in other crises served to soothe and heal. In Bushwick, home to dozens of churches, congregations are searching for means to
        connect despite the barriers.</p>
      <p>It has not been easy. Celeste Mattis, a member of Bushwick United Methodist Church, said that before the pandemic, the congregation would gather after Sunday service and have lunch. “Now we don’t have anything, just rush home after service,”
        she said. “Normally we would greet with hugs, now it’s a fist bump or elbow.” </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, for some, attending services in person remains meaningful and necessary, even with these constraints.</p>
      <p>Though seniors are among the highest-risk groups for COVID-19, Rev. Sharon Petgrave-Cundy, the pastor of Bushwick United Methodist Church, said that in her congregation they are often among the most eager to return to in-person services. “We
        just had a conversation with one of my seniors. She said, ‘I just want to come back to church.’' The woman would take the bus to the park and people-watch, alone, just to be near people again. In such cases, Rev. Petgrave-Cundy works with
        seniors’ families to ensure they can return to church safely. </p>
      <p>Many others, though, don’t feel comfortable attending in-person services. For those isolated at home, some congregation leaders have found creative ways to leverage technology to support them.</p>
      <p>Hunter Forman, a worship leader at Swerve Church, a recently-established Baptist church in Bushwick, posted a Facebook ad offering prayer and conversation. “That's what people seem to need,” he said. He set the ad’s radius to Bushwick,
        visible to anyone in the neighborhood who searched for help. Many people messaged him, sharing their struggles in detail.</p>
      <p>For some faith communities, platforms like Zoom have created unexpected opportunities for intimacy.</p>
      <p>During the open prayer part of Bushwick Abbey’s Sunday service, members offer prayers via the Zoom chat function, and then one person reads them aloud. “Typically, during prayers for the people, nobody says anything in church,” said Eve
        Strillacci, a member of Bushwick Abbey. But she said there’s something liberating about the chat box: It allows you to say things that you might otherwise be too embarrassed or emotional to say aloud in person. </p>
      <p>“It’s not just important to say them, it’s important for other people to hear them. I think there's something really unifying about knowing you're not the only person scared about this, or mourning that,” she added. “It builds that
        connection that doesn't exist if everyone stays silent.”</p><br>
